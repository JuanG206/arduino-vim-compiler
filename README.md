arduino-vim-compiler

This is a small Bash project for compiling and uploading code to an Arduino (ATmega328P) / Arduino Uno without relying on the Arduino IDE, allowing development directly in Vim or any other text editor in a Linux environment.

- Fast Compilation: Uses avr-gcc to compile C code.
- Automatic Uploading: Uses avrdude to upload firmware to the board.
- No Heavy IDEs: Ideal for those who prefer a lightweight workflow.
- Vim-Compatible: Integrates with :make in Vim.
